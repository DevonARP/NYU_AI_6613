You can just run the project straight from the Baseline.ipynb file and then from the AI_Improvement.ipynb file. Just need to change the destination folder for the saved files, the code will generate the fiels itself.

If you want a faster method however all of the file links above have the generated files so you can just run download them and run them. The features.npy and ModelReal are needed for the Baseline file and the impovfeatures.npy is needed for the AI_Improvement. The otehr three files are needed in order to get the original image and name that will be queried from the models, so each file needs them. Destinations for the files need to be changed for this method as well.
